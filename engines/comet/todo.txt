Todo:
-------
- More work on the menu system
- More mouse control (only works in a few menus so far)
- Save/Load code (from GMM and game itself)
- Load from Gui
- Return to Gui
- Switch savegame system to Serializer
- Dirty rectangles
  The original doesn't do any dirty rectangles and always blits the whole workscreen.
  Since the game uses vectors we'll have to see if/how this could be implemented.

Bugs:
-------
- Player stuck after loading when user input disabled
- Also in the original: Pressing enter will also skip sound effects, this looks like a bug in the if condition
