[12/08/2013 20:21:19] Liron Barzilai: Here is a short technical summary:

1. Great new touch-controls â€“ very easy to play on touch screens.
2. Improved graphics using scalers in 3 levels: software, hardware-low, hardware-high.
3. Completely new menus and a new save/load system.
4. Enhanced Stereo Music for the entire game (from James)
5. Six languages including English with both voice and subtitles, German voice or German subtitles.
[12/08/2013 20:22:20] Eugene Sandulenko: hope those touch controls are not hacks into the engine like what was done with FOTAQ
[12/08/2013 20:23:38] Liron Barzilai: Don't know really about the code itself but it was done by a skilled, different, developer.
[12/08/2013 20:24:29] Liron Barzilai: But i know we did detect things that happens in the engine and probably even modify them
[12/08/2013 20:28:03] Liron Barzilai: That reminds me about the other thing I wanted to ask. How can we co-operate the same way as you and DotEmu ? Which I guess you are good with the way the publish their code.
